  <p> 
  The high cost and short supply of quality child care is holding back many working parents with infants and toddlers — especially moms. <b>This is an equity issue. </b> Women with infants and toddlers comprise the greatest percentage of women who leave the workforce due to lack of child care. This reduces not only their earnings today, but their potential earnings and career advancement in the future.
