# babysitter-review-app

The purpose of BabyCareHub.com is to create a platform where low-income women can find reliable and empathetic care providers/volunteers willing to provide low-cost or even free babysitting hours, giving them much-needed respite and support in their caregiving responsibilities.

My intended users are low-income women who are in need of occasional babysitting assistance due to financial constraints. Additionally, care service providers and volunteers who are compassionate and willing to contribute their time and childcare skills are also a significant audience.
